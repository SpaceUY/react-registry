# Documentation Requirements

## Overview

This directory is where you should place your project's documentation. The following sections outline the essential documentation you should create to maintain a well-documented codebase.

## Required Documentation

### Core Architecture

Create these documents to explain your system design:

- **`architecture.md`** - High-level system design, patterns used, and architectural decisions
- **`project-structure.md`** - Detailed explanation of your directory organization and file purposes
- **`modules.md`** - How your feature modules are organized and structured

### Implementation Guides

Create guides for developers working on your project:

- **`components.md`** - Your component development standards, patterns, and conventions
- **`state-management.md`** - How state is managed in your application (stores, context, etc.)
- **`routing.md`** - Your routing configuration and navigation patterns
- **`layouts.md`** - How your layout system works and how to create new layouts

### Configuration

Document your setup and configuration:

- **`environment.md`** - Environment variables, configuration files, and their purposes
- **`build.md`** - Build process, deployment configuration, and build scripts
- **`development.md`** - Local development environment setup and requirements

### Features & Utilities

Document your tools and helpers:

- **`utils.md`** - Utility functions, helper libraries, and their usage
- **`hooks.md`** - Custom React hooks and their purposes
- **`services.md`** - API integrations, external services, and data fetching patterns
- **`error-handling.md`** - Error boundaries, error management, and debugging

### Best Practices

Establish standards for your team:

- **`coding-standards.md`** - Code style, conventions, and formatting rules
- **`testing.md`** - Testing strategies, patterns, and requirements
- **`performance.md`** - Performance optimization guidelines and monitoring
- **`security.md`** - Security best practices, authentication, and authorization

## Documentation Guidelines

### File Naming

- Use kebab-case: `feature-name.md`
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the content
- Group related documentation in subdirectories if needed

### Content Structure

Each document should include:

1. **Title** - Clear, descriptive heading
2. **Overview** - Brief description of what the document covers
3. **Prerequisites** - Any requirements or dependencies
4. **Main Content** - Detailed information with examples
5. **Examples** - Code examples and use cases
6. **Related Links** - References to other relevant documentation

### Code Examples

- Include TypeScript examples where applicable
- Provide complete, runnable code snippets
- Include both basic and advanced usage patterns
- Add comments explaining complex logic

### Maintenance

- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Review and update documentation during code reviews
- Include last updated dates for critical documentation

## Getting Started

1. Start with **`architecture.md`** to document your system design
2. Create **`project-structure.md`** to explain your file organization
3. Add **`development.md`** for setup instructions
4. Build out implementation guides as you develop features
5. Establish best practices documents for team standards

## Tips for Good Documentation

- Write for your team's skill level and experience
- Include practical examples and use cases
- Keep it concise but comprehensive
- Use diagrams when helpful (Mermaid, PlantUML, or images)
- Link to external resources when appropriate
- Maintain a consistent tone and style throughout

**Note**: Create documentation that serves your team's needs. Start with the essentials and expand as your project grows.
