# Vite Template Integration Guide

## Overview

This Vite template provides a comprehensive foundation for React applications with pre-configured project structure, utilities, and components. The template includes commonly used development patterns and tools to accelerate project setup and maintain consistency across company projects.

## Integration Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Clean git working directory (recommended)
- Node.js and package manager (npm/yarn/pnpm) installed
- Existing Vite project or new project setup

### Installation Steps

1. **Backup Current Work**: Ensure your git status is clean to track changes effectively
2. **Review Dependencies**: Check your `package.json` for conflicting dependencies
3. **Copy Template Files**: Integrate template files into your project structure
4. **Update Imports**: Some imports may be commented out due to missing packages
5. **Install Dependencies**: Add any required packages to your project
6. **Test Integration**: Verify all components and utilities work as expected

## Important Considerations

### Component Updates Required

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Some components in this template are generic implementations and **must be updated** according to your current project's specific requirements, design system, and business logic. Do not use components as-is without proper review and customization.

### Commented Code

- Some imports and components are commented due to missing registry packages
- Review and uncomment code after installing required dependencies
- Update component implementations based on your project's specific needs

### File Integration

- **These files are intended as additions or updates to existing projects**
- **Do not blindly replace existing files without review**
- Merge carefully with existing code to avoid conflicts
- Consider your project's existing architecture and conventions

### Dependencies

- Review utility functions and components for external dependencies
- Install missing packages as needed
- Update import paths to match your project structure

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Environment Configuration**: Update `environment.ts` with your project-specific settings
2. **Routing Setup**: Configure `router.tsx` and module-specific routers for your application routes
3. **Layout Integration**: Customize layout components (`layout.tsx`, `auth-layout.tsx`) to match your design
4. **Module Structure**: Use the modular architecture pattern for organizing feature-specific code
5. **Component Integration**: Adapt theme and UI components to your design system
6. **Utility Functions**: Review and customize utility functions for your use cases
7. **Type Definitions**: Extend or modify types to match your data models
8. **State Management**: Configure stores according to your application's needs

## Best Practices

- Review all template files before integration
- Maintain consistent code style with your existing project
- Update documentation as you customize components
- Test thoroughly after integration
- Consider your team's coding standards and conventions
- **Always customize components to match your project's specific requirements**

**Note**: This template is designed for developer use and should be customized based on project requirements and team standards. Components are provided as starting points and require project-specific implementation.
